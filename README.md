# smartcook

This is just a work in progress site, that is already paired with API. It still has some issues, such as not properly working filters, but I'm working on it. In next couple of days it should have added features such as searchbar and properly working filtering.

In the meantime I managed to put here "a few" recipies, used a scroll overflow, due to mobile compatibility and filtering (which is still in development)
