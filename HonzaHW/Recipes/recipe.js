      "description": "Grease the baking tray, sprinkle with coarse flour and set aside. Crack the eggs and separate them into yolks and whites. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. How to whip stiff snow from egg whites? Beat the egg yolks with powdered sugar. Add oil, flour mixed with baking powder and cocoa and carefully mix in the whipped stiff snow. How to mix the whipped snow into the dough Pour the created dough and spread it on the prepared tray, put it in the oven heated to 180°C and bake for about 10 minutes at 180°C. After baking, let the sponge cake cool down. While the body is cooling, we will prepare a soft cream. Beat room temperature butter with sugar and beat cottage cheese at the same temperature. Spread cream on the cooled sponge sheet and let it harden in the cold. Prepare the frosting by breaking the chocolate into the melted fat and stirring until a smooth mass is formed. While constantly stirring, gradually add milk by spoonfuls. Pour the smooth glaze over the pudding and let it harden.",
